\section {Automatic Personality Recognition}
\label{sec: APRecognition}

There has been works on improving the performance results of APR. One example was the work of \citet{Aljuhani_Al_Malaise_Al_Ghamdi_Alghamdi_Saleem_2025}, where they proposed a new model called APR\_ConvLSTM that utilized both CNN and Bi-LSTM to improve the APR performance. The key feature of the model was its efficient process of predicting all traits from Big Five personality traits that did not involve "laborious feature engineering". It boasted 79.01\% and 80.56\% on Accuracy and F-1 score, respectively.

A work from last year 2024 by \citet{Chen_Tsai_Ha_2024} used a model that consisted of XLNet, refined highway units, a switching module, and a fully-connected layer. It used a dataset that featured English and Chinese language. They measured the performance of the model, which had the accuracies of 64.79\% and 64.43\% for Big Five personality traits on English and Chinese, respectively.

\section{Personality in Social Media Data}
\label{sec:Personality}
The study of personality traits in relation to social media behavior has gained significant attention in recent years. Several studies have explored how different personality characteristics influence social media engagement, online branding, and digital interactions.

Tighe and Cheng (2018) examined the personality traits of Filipino Twitter users by analyzing their linguistic patterns on the platform. Their study employed natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as n-gram analysis and sentiment analysis, to predict users' Big Five personality traits based on their tweets. The results demonstrated that extroversion and openness were strongly associated with higher Twitter activity, while agreeableness and conscientiousness exhibited weaker correlations. This research contributed to the growing field of automated personality recognition using social media data.

Acopio and Bance (2016) investigated how personality traits predict Facebook usage patterns among Filipino college students. Using the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and the Facebook Intensity Scale, their study found that extraversion and openness positively correlated with higher levels of Facebook engagement, while conscientious individuals showed lower usage rates. This study reinforced the idea that personality significantly shapes social media behaviors and interaction levels.

In the context of personal branding, Hontiveros (2022) analyzed how social media engagement influences the development of an authentic personal brand among students at Far Eastern University, Manila. By employing descriptive-predictive analysis and Chi-square tests, the study found that individuals with high social media activity tended to develop a stronger and more authentic online presence. This research underscores the role of social media as a tool for identity formation and self-presentation in the digital era.

Similarly, Mitu and Nabung (2022) explored the influence of personality traits on social media advertising effectiveness. Using psychometric assessments and regression analysis, their study found that certain personality traits, such as openness and extraversion, were linked to increased responsiveness to targeted advertisements. Their findings suggest that advertisers can improve engagement by tailoring social media campaigns to users' personality profiles.

Lastly, Reyes et al. (2021) examined the relationship between celebrity admiration and social media usage among Filipino youth. Their study, which utilized the Celebrity Attitude Scale (CAS) and the Social Media Addiction Scale, found that intense admiration of celebrities correlated with excessive social media use. The research highlights the psychological and behavioral impact of celebrity culture on young individuals’ digital consumption patterns.

These studies collectively provide a deeper understanding of how personality traits shape social media engagement, branding, advertising effectiveness, and online behaviors. Their findings offer valuable insights for researchers, marketers, and digital platform developers seeking to optimize user engagement and online interactions.

\section{Multimodal Approaches to APR}
\label{sec: MMApproaches}
The earliest multimodal APR studies primarily focused on audio and visual features extracted from recorded conversations and behavioral interactions. \citet{Pianesi2008} conducted a study on multimodal behavioral analysis in multi-party meetings, utilizing SVM classifiers to predict Big Five personality traits and Locus of Control based on speech and facial expressions. Their results showed that facial features contributed significantly to extraversion classification, while vocal features were more informative for conscientiousness.

Following this, \citet{Sidorov2014} employed a similar audio-visual approach using data from the SEMAINE dataset, which consists of emotionally colored conversations. The study evaluated different segmentation techniques to improve classification accuracy, concluding that shorter segments provided better performance for certain personality traits.

Expanding on audio-visual models, \citet{Lima2022} introduced a deep learning approach, incorporating text data alongside audio and visual cues. Their research used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process sequential multimodal data, extracting temporal dependencies in social interactions. Their model was trained on 9.1 million parameters, demonstrating the scalability and computational complexity of deep learning-based APR systems.

As social media platforms became a dominant mode of communication, researchers shifted towards analyzing text and image data to infer personality traits. \citet{Machajdik2010} introduced an affective image classification model, which extracted color, texture, and composition-based features to predict emotional responses. Although not directly designed for personality classification, their findings laid the foundation for future studies connecting visual aesthetics with personality traits.

\citet{Xianyu2016} extended this approach by introducing a heterogeneity-entropy-based deep learning framework that combined text, images, and social media interactions. Their model used Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Autoencoders to extract latent personality features, highlighting how unsupervised learning techniques can capture subtle personality cues across modalities.

\citet{Skowron2016} further refined multimodal approaches by integrating linguistic, visual, and metadata features from Twitter and Instagram. Their study incorporated LIWC for linguistic analysis and emotion detection techniques from Machajdik and Hanbury (2010) to extract visual features. Their findings demonstrated that cross-platform personality modeling improved accuracy, emphasizing that personality traits manifest differently across different social networks.

Advancements in machine learning-based personality prediction have allowed researchers to refine image and text-based multimodal models for social media applications. \citet{Ferwerda2018} developed a personality recognition model based on Instagram images, utilizing the Google Vision API for image content extraction and a ZeroR classifier for baseline evaluation. Their results indicated that image aesthetics and content types strongly correlate with personality traits, particularly in openness and extraversion classification.

Similarly, \citet{Batrinca2016} examined multimodal cues in team-based interactions, incorporating speech, body movements, and facial expressions to model collaborative personality traits. Their study used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and SVMs, demonstrating that nonverbal behavior plays a significant role in personality assessments within group settings.

\citet{Branz2020} refined the image-based personality recognition model by analyzing color preferences in Instagram photos. Their study confirmed that specific color choices (e.g., dominant red hues) correlated with openness, while blue hues were linked to conscientiousness. The study utilized k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and SVMs, establishing a connection between color psychology and personality traits in digital environments.

The latest advancements in multimodal APR have shifted toward deep learning-based models, with an emphasis on personalization and adaptive AI techniques. \citet{Salam2022} introduced a personalized personality prediction model, utilizing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for different user demographics. Their study found that customized models outperformed generic APR models, reinforcing the importance of personalization in AI-driven personality recognition.

Building on deep learning methodologies, \citet{Lima2022} leveraged sequential data modeling to improve real-time personality prediction. Their model incorporated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrating that capturing temporal dependencies enhances classification accuracy. Their research concluded that personality traits are not static but evolve based on user interactions, emphasizing the potential of adaptive AI-driven personality assessments.

\section{Filipino APR}
\label{sec: FilipinoAPR}
Filipino APR remains an underexplored domain. Existing APR research is mostly focused on English-speaking populations although there is a rise of studies that have developed specific models for different languages, namely Bahasa Indonesian, Chinese, and Egyptian \citep{Siddique2019, Salem2019, Adi2018}. What makes Filipino APR distinct from these other languages is the presence of multiple languages, some of which include an array of unique regional languages \citep{Tighe_Acorda_Agno_Gano_Go_Santiago_Sedillo_2022,tighe_modeling_2018}. Moreover, code-switching is prominent in multilingual people which adds another layer of complexity.

The first venture to Filipino APR was conducted by \citet{tighe_modeling_2018} wherein they analyzed linguistic data from 250 Filipino Twitter users. Due to there being a lack of Filipino APR datasets, \citet{Tighe_Acorda_Agno_Gano_Go_Santiago_Sedillo_2022} constructed the PagkataoKo dataset which contains data from 3,128 Filipino Twitter/Instagram users and now consists of both text and image data. Since then, several studies have been conducted using the PagkataoKo dataset but none of which so far have integrated image data.

This paper seeks to contribute to Filipino APR by exploring the effects of fusing image data as a feature. Fusion and information extraction techniques from previous multimodal studies would serve as a guide for this research’s methodology.


%Previous draft
%\citet{Pennebaker1999} explored on their study how language use can reflect the personality style of someone. Using a computerized word-based text analysis program, the structure, validity, and reliability of the written language was examined. From there it was found that one's linguistic style is a consequential way to explore personality.

%This was further explored in a study by \citet{Mairesse2007} in which the recognition of the Big Five Personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) on both text and conversation was first experimented using both self rating and observer ratings of personality. From the experimentation done with the various models: classification, ranking, and regression; the ranking models performed best overall.

%The PagkataoKo dataset analyzed in this paper has been used in the studies of undergraduates, graduates, and professionals at DLSU. These various studies primarily involved modeling Filipino users’ personality traits or Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) through their usage of the Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) social media sites, as was the purpose of the creation of the dataset. 

%The dataset contains data on Filipino social media users’ social media activity on Instagram and Twitter. This includes features like post images and captions,  profile pictures, follower and following counts, and post count. It also includes the user’s BFI scores.

%Among the undergraduate and graduate studies that pursued the analysis of this dataset, the majority of them utilized only the X data, focusing on natural language processing. Techniques such as word embedding models, topic modeling, feature extraction, and other models were used to predict the BFI personality traits of users. One used both X and Instagram, but only the text data was used. There also exists another study that analyzed the visual features of Instagram image data and used this to predict personality traits. Lastly, a published study also used text processing on the X data for the same purpose.

%X was a more popular choice for analysis as the platform's main focus is that it is more text-based and the captions hold the most importance whereas on Instagram, it is more secondary. This leaves the Instagram portion of the dataset relatively unexplored compared to the X data, so there is little information about image processing in this dataset. However, this leaves open the potential for exploring images and their relation to personality, specifically the BFI scores, adding to the one research that was done on this topic. 

%Filipinos use social media in many ways. They use it for connecting with other people, sharing information, speaking out, and optimizing productivity \citep{10.1007/978-3-031-61543-6_24}. However, even though they are aware of the presence of social media, \citet{Cruz_Jamias_2013} found that Filipino researchers rarely use social media to their advantage. This demonstrates that each demographic in the Philippines has a different level of social media use.

%Social media has many effects in the Philippines. For instance, it plays a role in youth political participation. \citet{Ibardeloza2022-pz} found that social media helps the youth to be more exposed to radical involvement. It also has a positive effect on “peer interpersonal relationships” yet slightly negative on familial relationships \citep{Bristol2016TheDM}.

%Recent studies have explored the potential of Instagram image data to infer users' personality traits. \citet{ferwerda2016} analyzed features such as hue, brightness, and saturation in users' photos, finding significant correlations between these visual elements and the Big Five personality traits. Their findings suggest that individuals' choices in photo appearance can reflect underlying personality characteristics. 

%Further research by \citet{Reece2017-qw} utilized machine learning to examine Instagram photos for markers of depression. By analyzing color properties, metadata, and the presence of faces, their model successfully identified depressive indicators, highlighting the platform's potential for mental health screening. 

%Additionally, a study by \citet{Harris2019-gq} investigated the accuracy of personality portrayal on Instagram by comparing observers' perceptions of account holders' personalities with the account holders' self-reported traits. The results indicated discrepancies, suggesting that while certain visual cues can convey personality aspects, they may also lead to misinterpretations. 

%Collectively, these studies underscore the viability of leveraging Instagram image data to assess users' personality traits and mental health status, though they also caution against overreliance on visual cues due to potential misrepresentations.
