 	title={Convolutional Bi-LSTM for Automatic Personality Recognition From Social Media Texts}, 
 	volume={13}, 
 	ISSN={2169-3536}, 
 	DOI={10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3558714}, 
 	abstractNote={Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) has received much attention in recent years due to its wide range of important applications across various fields. The growing use of online social networks provides valuable opportunities for APR, as a strong correlation has been found between what users post on these platforms and their personality traits. Consequently, various APR models have been developed to infer the Big Five personality traits from social media user-generated texts. However, most of these models heavily relied on hand-crafted features, which are unable to capture deep contextual information and learn complex patterns from texts. More importantly, the performance of text-based APR is still unsatisfactory, especially at the level of each personality dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a new model, called APR_ConvLSTM, that aims to improve text-based APR performance by integrating two robust deep learning architectures: CNN and Bi-LSTM. Unlike existing APR models, the APR_ConvLSTM is a unified end-to-end model where all personality traits are predicted simultaneously and effectively without a need for laborious feature engineering. We also developed a new labeled Big Five personality dataset, called X-Big5, which has been in need for a long time in the APR field. Extensive experiments on the X-Big5 and a publicly available benchmark dataset (PAN-2015 Author Profiling) demonstrate the promising performance of our model over its contenders. Overall, the proposed model achieved the highest Accuracy and F-1 score of 79.51% and 86.54% on the PAN-2015 dataset and 87.95% and 81.35%, respectively, on the X-Big5 dataset. Moreover, it shows promising performance over its competitors, with the highest average Accuracy and F-1 score of 79.01% and 80.56%, respectively, on the combined dataset. The model reached competitive results in predicting Openness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism traits with the highest F1 scores of 88.60%, 77.35%, 76.16%, and 74.52%, respectively, on the combined dataset. The proposed model can positively impact the analysis of social media text generated by different users and help identify their personality traits.},

	DOI={10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558116}, 
	abstractNote={This study introduces an Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) model, named XLNet refined-highway-switch network, comprising XLNet, refined highway units, a switching module, and a fully-connected layer. The pretrained XLNet is employed to extract semantic features from text. The refined highway units with the dense connections are explored. Additionally, our study delves into the optimized computation structures between the refined highway and switching module to unearth personality- related features. Notably, this APR model incorporates punctuation and stop words in text, resulting in a notable accuracy boost of up to 6.79%. Through extensive experiments on the integrated datasets which combine My Personality, Essays, and Friends Persona, the proposed model achieves the best average accuracies of64.79% and 64.43% for Big-5 personality traits on English and Chinese versions, respectively, as compared to conventional models. Furthermore, we implemented the proposed APR model in a retrieval-based chatbot, utilizing Jaccard distance to select the most suitable personality responses for interactions, yielding promising results in subject tests. Consequently, the proposed APR model can be widely used in various personalized applications related to personality traits.},

Numerous studies have indicated that understanding the role of personality in the learning process can facilitate learning. Hence, personality identification in e-learning is a critical issue in education. In this study, we propose the enhanced extended nearest neighbor (EENN) algorithm to automatically identify two of the Big Five personality traits from students' behavior in online learning: openness to experience and extraversion. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a fivefold cross-validation approach on data from 662 senior high school students. The experimental results indicate that the EENN method can automatically recognize personality at an average accuracy of 0.758. The optimized method that combines EENN with particle swarm optimization significantly improves the identification, resulting in an average accuracy of 0.976. The results can benefit students by increasing the accuracy of personalization based on their personality traits, while simultaneously allowing them to be better understood and possibly allowing their instructors to provide more appropriate learning interventions.},

	abstract = {Personality can be defined as the combination of behavior, emotion, motivation, and thoughts that aim at describing various aspects of human behavior based on a few stable and measurable characteristics. Considering the fact that our personality has a remarkable influence in our daily life, automatic recognition of a person's personality attributes can provide many essential practical applications in various aspects of cognitive science. deep learning based method for the task of personality recognition from text is proposed in this paper. Among various deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated profound efficiency in natural language processing and especially personality detection. Owing to the fact that various filter sizes in CNN may influence its performance, we decided to combine CNN with AdaBoost, a classical ensemble algorithm, to consider the possibility of using the contribution of various filter lengths and gasp their potential in the final classification via combining various classifiers with respective filter size using AdaBoost. Our proposed method was validated on the Essay dataset by conducting a series of experiments and the empirical results demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method compared to both machine learning and deep learning methods for the task of personality recognition.},

We recruited volunteers among Facebook users and collected a dataset of profile pictures, labeled with gold standard self-assessed personality and interaction style labels. Then, we exploited a bag-of-visual-words technique to extract features from pictures. Finally, different machine learning approaches were used to test the effectiveness of these features in predicting personality and interaction style traits. Our good results show that this task is very promising, because profile pictures convey a lot of information about a user and are directly connected to impression formation and identity management.},

	abstract = {Recent studies in the field of text-based personality recognition experiment with different languages, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning algorithms to create better and more accurate models; however, little focus is placed on exploring the language use of a group of individuals defined by nationality. Individuals of the same nationality share certain practices and communicate certain ideas that can become embedded into their natural language. Many nationals are also not limited to speaking just one language, such as how Filipinos speak Filipino and English, the two national languages of the Philippines. The addition of several regional/indigenous languages, along with the commonness of code-switching, allow for a Filipino to have a rich vocabulary. This presents an opportunity to create a text-based personality model based on how Filipinos speak, regardless of the language they use. To do so, data was collected from 250 Filipino Twitter users. Different combinations of data processing techniques were experimented upon to create personality models for each of the Big Five. The results for both regression and classification show that Conscientiousness is consistently the easiest trait to model, followed by Extraversion. Classification models for Agreeableness and Neuroticism had subpar performances, but performed better than those of Openness. An analysis on personality trait score representation showed that classifying extreme outliers generally produce better results for all traits except for Neuroticism and Openness.},

	abstract = {It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content.  One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans.  Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications.  However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits.  This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality.  While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.},

This study investigates platform-swinging among older adults, where they strategically switch between platforms to fulfill specific needs and desires. We interviewed 11 older adults living in the Philippines in November of 2023 who used at least two social media platforms. The platform combination favored by older adults varies based on their context. However, a common combination observed in this study included Facebook, Messenger, and YouTube. Guided by the Uses and Gratification Theory, we applied thematic analysis and revealed four major themes that motivate older adults to practice platform-swinging: managing digital ties, transferring information, uplifting and managing emotions, and optimizing work processes. The respondents' ability to practice platform-swinging is facilitated by adequate internet connectivity and devices, and familiarity with the different platforms.",

By applying these filters, users are able to create a style that they want to express to their audience. In this study we tried to infer personality traits from the way users manipulate the appearance of their pictures by applying filters to them. To investigate this relationship, we studied the relationship between picture features and personality traits. To collect data, we conducted an online survey where we asked participants to fill in a personality questionnaire, and grant us access to their Instagram account through the Instagram API. Among 113 participants and 22,398 extracted Instagram pictures, we found distinct picture features (e.g., relevant to hue, brightness, saturation) that are related to personality traits. Our findings suggest a relationship between personality traits and these picture features. Based on our findings, we also show that personality traits can be accurately predicted. This allow for new ways to extract personality traits from social media trails, and new ways to facilitate personalized systems.",

               investigation into idealized online self-presentation",
  author    = "Harris, Elspbeth and Bardey, Aurore C",
  abstract  = "Instagram users are consistently exposed to the presentation of
               idealized selves. Although studies have examined online
               self-presentation in general, little attention has been paid to
               self-presentation in a visual online setting, such as Instagram.
               The present investigation examined the extent to which Instagram
               account holders engage in idealized online self-presentation
               through a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative results (Study 1)
               showed a difference between how the observers perceived the
               Instagram account holders' personality and the Instagram account
               holders' personality self-reports. Qualitative findings (Study
               2) revealed four major themes: (1) Selfies as a personality
               predictor; (2) Faces as a personality predictor; (3) Layout as
               personality predictor, (4) Misuse of social networks and its
               consequence for communication. Our results also indicated that
               the halo effect is integral to the online self-presentational
               process, suggesting that an aesthetically pleasing Instagram
               account or account holder will be better received and thought as
               having particularly positive personality traits.",
