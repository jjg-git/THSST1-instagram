Numerous studies have indicated that understanding the role of personality in the learning process can facilitate learning. Hence, personality identification in e-learning is a critical issue in education. In this study, we propose the enhanced extended nearest neighbor (EENN) algorithm to automatically identify two of the Big Five personality traits from students' behavior in online learning: openness to experience and extraversion. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a fivefold cross-validation approach on data from 662 senior high school students. The experimental results indicate that the EENN method can automatically recognize personality at an average accuracy of 0.758. The optimized method that combines EENN with particle swarm optimization significantly improves the identification, resulting in an average accuracy of 0.976. The results can benefit students by increasing the accuracy of personalization based on their personality traits, while simultaneously allowing them to be better understood and possibly allowing their instructors to provide more appropriate learning interventions.},

Considering the fact that our personality has a remarkable influence in our daily life, automatic recognition of a person's personality attributes can provide many essential practical applications in various aspects of cognitive science. deep learning based method for the task of personality recognition from text is proposed in this paper. Among various deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated profound efficiency in natural language processing and especially personality detection. Owing to the fact that various filter sizes in CNN may influence its performance, we decided to combine CNN with AdaBoost, a classical ensemble algorithm, to consider the possibility of using the contribution of various filter lengths and gasp their potential in the final classification via combining various classifiers with respective filter size using AdaBoost. Our proposed method was validated on the Essay dataset by conducting a series of experiments and the empirical results demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method compared to both machine learning and deep learning methods for the task of personality recognition.},

Finally, different machine learning approaches were used to test the effectiveness of these features in predicting personality and interaction style traits.

	abstract = {Recent studies in the field of text-based personality recognition experiment with different languages, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning algorithms to create better and more accurate models; however, little focus is placed on exploring the language use of a group of individuals defined by nationality. Individuals of the same nationality share certain practices and communicate certain ideas that can become embedded into their natural language. Many nationals are also not limited to speaking just one language, such as how Filipinos speak Filipino and English, the two national languages of the Philippines. The addition of several regional/indigenous languages, along with the commonness of code-switching, allow for a Filipino to have a rich vocabulary. This presents an opportunity to create a text-based personality model based on how Filipinos speak, regardless of the language they use. To do so, data was collected from 250 Filipino Twitter users. Different combinations of data processing techniques were experimented upon to create personality models for each of the Big Five. The results for both regression and classification show that Conscientiousness is consistently the easiest trait to model, followed by Extraversion. Classification models for Agreeableness and Neuroticism had subpar performances, but performed better than those of Openness. An analysis on personality trait score representation showed that classifying extreme outliers generally produce better results for all traits except for Neuroticism and Openness.},

	abstract = {It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content.  One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans.  Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications.  However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits.  This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality.  While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.},

We use the YouTube personality data set and use logistic regression model with a ridge estimator for the classification purpose.

The researchers in the field of computer science have found in the social media platforms an easier way achieve these studies. As they are widespread and used by most individuals. Social media enables people to share most of their thoughts, feelings and daily activities. Researches all-over the world tried to use that rich source of data to predict personality traits in many different languages, but none of them have tried to work with the Arabic language. Although Arab social media users represent a large sector of social media users. This paper introduces AraPersonality. A Personality traits dataset that was gathered from Egyptian dialect twitter users. It is consisted of about 92 users twitter feeds. This paper discusses how it was gathered, its properties, statistics and experiments, its experimental results can be considered the baseline. The average of the best result in each trait is 0.59 and 0.33 in binary and multiclass representation respectively according to f1-score. These results can be considered as a good start for a system that predict personality for Egyptian users.},

    abstract="As older adults embrace social media, their engagement extends across diverse platforms, each offering unique features and benefits. This study investigates platform-swinging among older adults, where they strategically switch between platforms to fulfill specific needs and desires. We interviewed 11 older adults living in the Philippines in November of 2023 who used at least two social media platforms. The platform combination favored by older adults varies based on their context. However, a common combination observed in this study included Facebook, Messenger, and YouTube. Guided by the Uses and Gratification Theory, we applied thematic analysis and revealed four major themes that motivate older adults to practice platform-swinging: managing digital ties, transferring information, uplifting and managing emotions, and optimizing work processes. The respondents' ability to practice platform-swinging is facilitated by adequate internet connectivity and devices, and familiarity with the different platforms.",

               understanding of the issues in the country and their engagement

               investigate the relationship between exposure to social media to
               the awareness on various social issues and the complex political
               involvement of youth. The study employed a correlational design
               of quantitative research approach use to analyze data gathered
               based on the conducted online survey of senior high school
               students from Tanauan City Integrated High School. In addition,
               this study applied a Pearson correlation to determine if a
               significant correlation existed. Findings showed that there is
               no significant connection between the respondents' social media
               exposure and their level of awareness regarding societal issues
               in the country. On the other hand, there is a significant
               relationship between the respondents' social media exposure and
               their level of radical involvement. This research demonstrates
               how a broader and more advanced understanding of youth's radical
               political participation associated with more comprehensive
               measures of social media use can help better understand the role
               of digital platforms in influencing political participatory
               behavior and awareness among the internet generation. It is
               recommendable that future researchers could focus on a different

    abstract="Instagram is a popular social networking application, which allows photo-sharing and applying different photo filters to adjust the appearance of a picture. By applying these filters, users are able to create a style that they want to express to their audience. In this study we tried to infer personality traits from the way users manipulate the appearance of their pictures by applying filters to them. To investigate this relationship, we studied the relationship between picture features and personality traits. To collect data, we conducted an online survey where we asked participants to fill in a personality questionnaire, and grant us access to their Instagram account through the Instagram API. Among 113 participants and 22,398 extracted Instagram pictures, we found distinct picture features (e.g., relevant to hue, brightness, saturation) that are related to personality traits. Our findings suggest a relationship between personality traits and these picture features. Based on our findings, we also show that personality traits can be accurately predicted. This allow for new ways to extract personality traits from social media trails, and new ways to facilitate personalized systems.",

               investigation into idealized online self-presentation",
  author    = "Harris, Elspbeth and Bardey, Aurore C",
  abstract  = "Instagram users are consistently exposed to the presentation of
               idealized selves. Although studies have examined online
               self-presentation in general, little attention has been paid to
               self-presentation in a visual online setting, such as Instagram.
               The present investigation examined the extent to which Instagram
               account holders engage in idealized online self-presentation
               through a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative results (Study 1)
               showed a difference between how the observers perceived the
               Instagram account holders' personality and the Instagram account
               holders' personality self-reports. Qualitative findings (Study
               2) revealed four major themes: (1) Selfies as a personality
               predictor; (2) Faces as a personality predictor; (3) Layout as
               personality predictor, (4) Misuse of social networks and its
               consequence for communication. Our results also indicated that
               the halo effect is integral to the online self-presentational
               process, suggesting that an aesthetically pleasing Instagram
               account or account holder will be better received and thought as
               having particularly positive personality traits.",
