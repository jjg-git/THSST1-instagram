% Describe the research area
Personality is defined as “patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior” \citep{Vinciarelli2014}. In a society, people develop opinions and treat each other differently based on their perception of the person’s personality. Understanding personality plays a significant role in fields such as psychology as this information can be used in studies of mental health and human behavior. 
%Research area ...
%This study's main research area is on personality computing. Personality computing is related to artificial intelligence and personality psychology by studying one's personality through a variety of computational techniques from different sources (usually text, multimedia, and social networks). Among the three main problems personality computing addresses; automatic personality recognition, perception, and synthesis \citep[p.~280]{Vinciarelli2014}; this study focuses on automatic personality recognition.
With the widespread adoption of social networking sites (SNS), personal content such as images, captions, and interactions has become publicly accessible on a large scale. This development has opened new avenues for research on personality inference using digital footprints. One such approach is Automatic Personality Recognition (APR), which involves inferring a person’s personality traits from their online activity.

% Describe the domain (where will you apply the topic)
Automatic personality recognition (APR) aims to infer the personality of an individual based on their digital footprint. APR has been traced back to the work of \citet{Pennebaker1999} wherein they asked the question of \textit{can language use reflect personality style?}

APR typically uses the Big Five Personality Model, which includes the traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. Researchers have explored various machine learning techniques—particularly deep learning models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs)—to link digital content to these personality traits. While early studies predominantly analyzed text-based features, more recent work has expanded to include multimodal data, such as images and videos, reflecting the evolving nature of online content.

Social media platforms like Instagram, which emphasize visual content, offer unique opportunities for personality analysis. Prior research suggests that user-generated content on these platforms often reflects personal expression in spontaneous and unintended ways, making them valuable for computational personality inference.
% Give a synthesis of previous work

% Synthesis of previous studies...
%\citet{Pennebaker1999} and \citet{Mairesse2007} had demonstrated the different ways of detecting personalities and emotions by analyzing the text with various language models. Due to that, social media had became a common place for the research of personality detection. The PagkataoKo dataset has been made with social media activity on Instagram and X (formerly known as Twitter). There were more studies using X's data than Instagram due to X being a more prominent platform with its text-based posts. However, \citet{ferwerda2016}, \cite{Reece2017-qw} and \cite{Harris2019-gq} made studies that showed analyzing photos was possible. Thus, researching on Instagram became more meaningful in this manner.
Previous studies have found success in the implementation of deep learning and deep neural networks in the field of APR \citep{Zhao2022}. The standard approach involves feature extraction, followed by machine learning techniques to associate extracted features with personality traits. Common models include deep neural networks (DNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). 

The widespread adoption of social media has further propelled APR research, providing large-scale, real-time behavioral data for personality inference. Studies suggest that social media interactions exhibit behavior that is “spontaneous and self-disclosing beyond intention” \citep{Vinciarelli2014}, making them valuable for personality analysis. Thus, many studies have taken to conducting personality analysis using data from personal social media profiles. Text was a common modality in their research, though a smaller number of papers have also explored image-based analysis. 

Despite growing research in APR, most studies have primarily focused on Western populations. Limited research has explored personality inference methods within Filipino contexts, particularly in using image-based data.

There are a number of studies that show improved performance of models when using multimodal approaches rather than unimodal, yet this approach remains largely underexplored in the context of Filipino automatic personality recognition (APR). Most existing studies focus solely on single-modal data, particularly text data. However, platforms like Instagram offer a rich source of multimodal data, specifically images and text, that could notably improve personality analysis. Exploring this untapped resource appears promising, especially considering the previous success of multimodal approaches in non-Filipino contexts.

% State the problem and the research question

% Paragraph containing the Problem Statement or the Research Question.

This study seeks to explore image-based APR methods tailored for Filipino users by leveraging Instagram data, integrating psychological analysis and computational techniques. The study aims to address the question: \textit{How can Instagram content, including images and captions, be used to infer a Filipino’s personality traits based on psychological and computational analysis?}

% This section ends with a discussion on the problem/s faced by or that still exist in the specific technology or field (e.g., limitations of existing software or algorithms). It should not contain your research objectives or goal; instead, the problem statement would lead to the research objectives to be stated in 1.2.

% \subsection{Figures}

% Often times, a graph, illustration, screenshot, or any image can help a reader better understand what we say in text. In academic writing, we call them \textbf{figures}. Please add as many figures as necessary to help build your narrative, but do not go overboard. 

% You can add figures in JPG or PNG format as shown in Figure \ref{fig:disneystock}. All figures should also have a descriptive caption. As a general principle, your caption should adequately describe what is shown in the figure, and not just short texts. If we remove all the surrounding text, the reader should still understand what your figure is. 

% All figures should be referred to at least once in the surrounding paragraphs. Make sure that you explain what the figure is all about, and that you refer to your figure. You can also use the surround paragraphs to highlight key insights or parts of your figure. For example, \figref{fig:disneystock} shows a graph of the performance of Disney stock from the 1980s to 2012.

% %--- the following example shows how to include a figure in PNG format
% \begin{figure}[t]                %-- use [t] to place figure at top, [b] to place at the bottom, [h] for here
%    \centering                    %-- use this to center the figure
%    \includegraphics{DisneyChart.png}      %-- include image file named as "disneychart.png" 
%    \caption{Disney's stock price chart from the 1980s up to 2012. The top chart shows the stock price in each month. The bottom chart shows the change in volume of transactions. The bars are colored based on the type of movement that happened in a month.}

\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec: objectives}
The integration of visual and textual data from social media platforms has emerged as a promising approach for inferring individual personality traits. Building upon this foundation, the primary aim of this study is to develop a multimodal framework for the automatic recognition of personality traits among Filipino Instagram users, utilizing both image and caption data. This research seeks to contribute to the field of personality computing by demonstrating how multimodal social media content can be harnessed for psychological assessment, with a specific focus on the Filipino demographic.

To achieve this aim, the study will pursue the following specific objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):} \\
	Perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset to examine the distribution, structure, and characteristics of the collected Instagram images and captions. This step is essential to identify relevant patterns, assess data quality, and inform subsequent stages of feature extraction and modeling.
	
	\item \textbf{Extract and Fuse Multimodal Features from Images and Captions:} \\
	Apply computer vision techniques to extract visual features from Instagram images—such as color schemes, composition, and depicted content—and natural language processing techniques to derive textual features from user captions—such as lexical diversity, sentiment, and linguistic style. These features will be fused to form a comprehensive representation of each user's social media activity.
	
	\item \textbf{Train Machine Learning Models for Personality Trait Prediction:} \\
	Develop machine learning models that utilize the combined multimodal feature sets to predict users’ personality traits. The study will investigate the effectiveness of various learning algorithms and evaluate the benefits of integrating visual and textual data in improving predictive performance.
	
	\item \textbf{Evaluate the Predictive Performance of the Framework:} \\
	Assess the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal personality recognition framework by comparing its performance to unimodal approaches that rely solely on either images or text. Evaluation will be based on appropriate metrics to determine predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.
\end{enumerate}

By achieving these objectives, this research aims to contribute to the field of personality computing by offering a comprehensive understanding of how Instagram content can be utilized for personality assessment, with a particular focus on the Filipino demographic.

% This subsection states the over--all goal that must be achieved to answer the problem. Address the following: Given your research challenge or opportunity, how do you intend to solve it? What is the main outcome of your research? What kind of contribution do you want to achieve?

% The \textbf{general objective} is broken down into three or more specific objectives. The \textbf{specific objectives} are relatively smaller objectives that help you attain your general objective. You can formulate your specific objectives based on your running questions about the project. For example, the group does not have a good picture yet of the different conversation patterns between humans that can be mimicked by conversational agents. A specific objective can be "to identify different human-human conversation patterns." These objectives must be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bounded.

% Reviewing related literature, studying a particular programming language or development tool (e.g., to study Windows/Object-Oriented/Graphics/C++ programming), and documentation to accomplish the general objective is inherent in all thesis projects and, therefore, must not be included here.

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Research}
\label{sec:scopelimitations}


	This research explores the use of classification-based machine learning techniques to recognize personality traits of Filipino Instagram users through a multimodal approach that incorporates both visual and textual content. The study aims to determine the viability of image based features in predicting the Big Five Personality Traits, which remains underexplored in the Philippine context. It focuses exclusively on Instagram, a platform that naturally supports multimodal data, to investigate whether combining visual and textual features enhances predictive accuracy compared to using a single modality.
	
	One major focus of the study is the application of classification algorithms rather than regression models. Since personality categories are evaluated in terms of trait presence rather than numerical ranges, classification is more appropriate for assigning discrete personality labels based on extracted features.
	
	To extract meaningful visual features from Instagram posts, the study uses edge detection techniques in image preprocessing. This allows for analysis of image structures, color composition, and content framing elements which have been correlated with personality in past research. While other preprocessing techniques exist, this study limits itself to edge detection to maintain methodological clarity and computational efficiency.
	
	The dataset is also restricted to Instagram posts that contain both an image and a caption, to fully support the multimodal nature of the study. Posts that lack either element are excluded to ensure a consistent data format and to support the objective of analyzing how the integration of visual and textual cues can improve personality recognition.
	
	This study limits its analysis to Filipino Instagram users, ensuring that the research addresses cultural nuances in personality expression. By focusing on the Philippine demographic, the study accounts for language-specific and culturally shaped patterns in online behavior, which are often overlooked in broader personality recognition studies.
	
	Finally, the study evaluates personality traits based on the Big Five Model (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism). This framework was selected due to its widespread use and empirical support in psychological and computational personality studies. Other models, such as MBTI, are excluded for the sake of standardization and comparability with related literature.

% This section discusses the boundaries, with respect to the objectives, of the research and the constraints within which the research will be developed. Describe what is and is not included in the scope of your research, supported by your main research question and findings of previous studies. Do not use weak excuses such as the lack of time and/or knowledge to perform the research.

% A good rule of thumb is to allocate one paragraph for each of your specific objectives that (1) contains a brief overview of the concept/theory and the purpose of doing the associated objective; and (2) includes a description of the scope/limitation of your study, and followed by brief purpose, rationale and/or justification for your decisions.

\section{Significance of the Study}
\label{sec: Significance}

This study aims to address the current research gap in Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) by exploring how multimodal data—specifically image and text content from Instagram—can be used to infer personality traits among Filipino users. Unlike many existing studies that rely on textual data from platforms like Twitter, this research expands the scope of APR by integrating visual analysis, thereby introducing an image-based personality prediction component into the local research landscape.

\textbf{The expected outputs of this study include:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item identifying which visual and textual features are most indicative of personality traits among Filipino Instagram users 
\item evaluating whether multimodal models outperform unimodal models in terms of prediction accuracy.
\end{itemize} 
These findings will be important for future researchers in computational psychology, affective computing, and artificial intelligence who seek to build more culturally sensitive and accurate personality models.

Moreover, the study contributes to a more inclusive understanding of digital personalities by incorporating Filipino social media behavior, which is often underrepresented in global datasets. The ability to recognize patterns specific to Filipino users has implications for building locally relevant tools and frameworks in psychological computing and user profiling.

While the primary contribution of the study is academic, its findings could also have practical relevance in fields such as digital marketing, recommendation systems, and online community management. For example, understanding how visual styles relate to personality may help refine audience segmentation strategies or improve content personalization. However, such applications are considered secondary to the primary aim of advancing research on multimodal APR in a Philippine context.
