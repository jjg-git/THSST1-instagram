%%This section gives the reader an overview of the specific technology or field in the international or local setting. The information regarding the technology or field should be contemporary and not

%%Follow the inverted pyramid to describe each of the following. Allocate one (1) paragraph per level in the pyramid. 

% Describe the research area
Personality is defined as “patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior” \citep{Vinciarelli2014}. In a society, people develop opinions and treat each other differently based on their perception of the person’s personality. Understanding personality plays a significant role in fields such as psychology as this information can be used in studies of mental health and human behavior. Alongside the rise of publicly available and easily accessible information on social networking sites (SNS), the field of personality computing has begun to garner increasing interest in the last few years. 

%Research area ...
%This study's main research area is on personality computing. Personality computing is related to artificial intelligence and personality psychology by studying one's personality through a variety of computational techniques from different sources (usually text, multimedia, and social networks). Among the three main problems personality computing addresses; automatic personality recognition, perception, and synthesis \citep[p.~280]{Vinciarelli2014}; this study focuses on automatic personality recognition.
Personality computing integrates artificial intelligence and personality psychology by analyzing personality traits using a variety of computational techniques from various data sources, such as text, multimedia, and social networks. In this area of study, personality often represented as quantifiable traits, with the Big Five Personality model being a widely used framework. The Big Five model categorizes personality into five traits, namely: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness neuroticism, and openness. 

Personality computing research is commonly divided into three subfields: Automatic Personality Recognition (APR), Automatic Personality Perception (APP), and Automatic Personality Synthesis (APS) \citep{Vinciarelli2014}.

% Describe the domain (where will you apply the topic)
Automatic personality recognition (APR) aims to infer the personality of an individual based on their digital footprint. APR has been traced back to the work of \citet{Pennebaker1999} wherein they asked the question of \textit{can language use reflect personality style?}

% Give a synthesis of previous work

% Synthesis of previous studies...
%\citet{Pennebaker1999} and \citet{Mairesse2007} had demonstrated the different ways of detecting personalities and emotions by analyzing the text with various language models. Due to that, social media had became a common place for the research of personality detection. The PagkataoKo dataset has been made with social media activity on Instagram and X (formerly known as Twitter). There were more studies using X's data than Instagram due to X being a more prominent platform with its text-based posts. However, \citet{ferwerda2016}, \cite{Reece2017-qw} and \cite{Harris2019-gq} made studies that showed analyzing photos was possible. Thus, researching on Instagram became more meaningful in this manner.
Previous studies have found success in the implementation of deep learning and deep neural networks in the field of APR \citep{Zhao2022}. The standard approach involves feature extraction, followed by machine learning techniques to associate extracted features with personality traits. Common models include deep neural networks (DNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). 

The widespread adoption of social media has further propelled APR research, providing large-scale, real-time behavioral data for personality inference. Studies suggest that social media interactions exhibit behavior that is “spontaneous and self-disclosing beyond intention” \citep{Vinciarelli2014}, making them valuable for personality analysis. Thus, many studies have taken to conducting personality analysis using data from personal social media profiles. Text was a common modality in their research, though a smaller number of papers have also explored image-based analysis. 

Despite growing research in APR, most studies have primarily focused on Western populations. Limited research has explored personality inference methods within Filipino contexts, particularly in using image-based data.

% State the problem and the research question

% Paragraph containing the Problem Statement or the Research Question.

This study seeks to explore image-based APR methods tailored for Filipino users by leveraging Instagram data, integrating psychological analysis and computational techniques. The study aims to address the question: \textit{How can Instagram content, including images and captions, be used to infer a Filipino’s personality traits based on psychological and computational analysis?}

% This section ends with a discussion on the problem/s faced by or that still exist in the specific technology or field (e.g., limitations of existing software or algorithms). It should not contain your research objectives or goal; instead, the problem statement would lead to the research objectives to be stated in 1.2.

% \subsection{Figures}

% Often times, a graph, illustration, screenshot, or any image can help a reader better understand what we say in text. In academic writing, we call them \textbf{figures}. Please add as many figures as necessary to help build your narrative, but do not go overboard. 

% You can add figures in JPG or PNG format as shown in Figure \ref{fig:disneystock}. All figures should also have a descriptive caption. As a general principle, your caption should adequately describe what is shown in the figure, and not just short texts. If we remove all the surrounding text, the reader should still understand what your figure is. 

% All figures should be referred to at least once in the surrounding paragraphs. Make sure that you explain what the figure is all about, and that you refer to your figure. You can also use the surround paragraphs to highlight key insights or parts of your figure. For example, \figref{fig:disneystock} shows a graph of the performance of Disney stock from the 1980s to 2012.

% %--- the following example shows how to include a figure in PNG format
% \begin{figure}[t]                %-- use [t] to place figure at top, [b] to place at the bottom, [h] for here
%    \centering                    %-- use this to center the figure
%    \includegraphics{DisneyChart.png}      %-- include image file named as "disneychart.png" 
%    \caption{Disney's stock price chart from the 1980s up to 2012. The top chart shows the stock price in each month. The bottom chart shows the change in volume of transactions. The bars are colored based on the type of movement that happened in a month.}

\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec: objectives}
The integration of visual and textual data from social media platforms has emerged as a promising approach to infer individual personality traits. Building upon this foundation, the primary objective of this research is to develop a multimodal framework for automatic personality recognition of Filipino Instagram users by analyzing both images and captions. The specific objectives are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{ \arabic*:}, leftmargin=*]
	\item \textbf{Extract and Analyze Visual Features from Images:} Utilize computer vision techniques to extract visual features from Instagram images, focusing on aspects such as color schemes, composition, and content, which have been linked to personality traits in previous studies.
	

	\item \textbf{Train Machine Learning Models using Multimodal Data for Personality Prediction:} Develop machine learning models that combine both visual and textual features to enhance the accuracy of personality trait predictions, leveraging the complementary information from both data modalities.
	
	\item \textbf{Evaluate the Predictive Performance of the Framework:} Assess the effectiveness of the multimodal framework by comparing its performance against unimodal approaches (using only images or captions) in predicting personality traits.
	
\end{enumerate}

By achieving these objectives, this research aims to contribute to the field of personality computing by offering a comprehensive understanding of how Instagram content can be utilized for personality assessment, with a particular focus on the Filipino demographic.

% This subsection states the over--all goal that must be achieved to answer the problem. Address the following: Given your research challenge or opportunity, how do you intend to solve it? What is the main outcome of your research? What kind of contribution do you want to achieve?

% The \textbf{general objective} is broken down into three or more specific objectives. The \textbf{specific objectives} are relatively smaller objectives that help you attain your general objective. You can formulate your specific objectives based on your running questions about the project. For example, the group does not have a good picture yet of the different conversation patterns between humans that can be mimicked by conversational agents. A specific objective can be "to identify different human-human conversation patterns." These objectives must be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bounded.

% Reviewing related literature, studying a particular programming language or development tool (e.g., to study Windows/Object-Oriented/Graphics/C++ programming), and documentation to accomplish the general objective is inherent in all thesis projects and, therefore, must not be included here.

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Research}
\label{sec:scopelimitations}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{ \arabic*:}, leftmargin=*]
	\item \textbf{Using Classification Machine Learning Techniques:} This study focuses on classifying the personality traits from Instagram images. Thus, it uses classification techniques instead of regression where it determines the value in the interval.
	 
	\item \textbf{Edge Detection:} Many image processing techniques are used to expand the number of data points in the dataset. However, this study relies on edge detection techniques to extract the visual features from Instagram images, focusing on aspects such as color schemes, composition, and content, which have been linked to personality traits in previous studies.
	
	\item \textbf{Including Instagram Posts With Both Photo and Caption:} The dataset is filtered to have posts that contain both the photo and the caption.
	
	\item \textbf{The Big Five Personality Traits:} In evaluating the predictive performance of the framework, the analysis is based on the big five personality traits.
	
	\item \textbf{Limited to Philippine Demographics:} To effectively investigate the cultural factors that influence the expression of personality traits of the Filipino Instagram users, the dataset contains post made by Filipino Instagram users.

\section{Significance of the Study}
\label{sec: Significance}

To date, the use of image features in Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) research in the Philippine setting remains largely unexplored. This study addresses that gap by investigating how visual content—specifically images shared by Filipino Instagram users—can reveal aspects of personality. While existing personality prediction studies have predominantly relied on textual data from platforms such as Twitter, our work expands this scope by incorporating Instagram’s multimodal nature and combining both text and image features.

By integrating visual elements with textual data in both English and Filipino, this research aims to determine whether personality prediction accuracy improves when using a multimodal approach compared to unimodal (text-only or image-only) methods. In doing so, this study not only introduces image-based analysis to Filipino APR but also examines how the fusion of modalities may enhance prediction performance.

Additionally, this research contributes to addressing the underrepresentation of Filipino social media users in personality recognition studies. This research highlights the potential of culturally and linguistically inclusive models that better reflect the diversity of online users in the Philippines.

Beyond academic contribution, the findings of this study may have practical applications in areas such as digital marketing, advertising, and social networking. As demonstrated in \citet{Matz2017} study on psychological targeting in digital marketing, aligning content with user personality traits can significantly boost engagement and conversion rates. Thus, insights from this research could inform strategies for more personalized and effective content delivery in online platforms.

\section{Research Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}


Our multimodal personality recognition pipeline employs intermediate fusion to integrate image, text, and metadata features from Filipino Instagram users. The methodology consists of six key phases:

\subsection{Preprocessing}
\label{subsec:preprocessing}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data Aggregation:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All posts grouped by \texttt{UserID} to create user-level profiles
		\item Metadata extraction: \texttt{PostCount}, \texttt{Following Count}, and temporal patterns
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Missing Data Handling:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Posts without captions retained for image-only analysis
		\item Text features imputed as zero vectors when missing
		\item Metadata-derived proxies (e.g., \texttt{PostCount} as activity indicator)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}
\label{subsec:eda}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Demographic Analysis:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Geographic distribution (Luzon/Visayas/Mindanao)
		\item Age/gender representation assessment
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Visual Pattern Discovery:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Color dominance analysis using HSV histograms
		\item Face detection via OpenCV's Haar cascades
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Temporal Trends:}
	\begin{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
\label{subsec:features}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Image Features:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{VGG-19:} Extracts texture/style features (filter usage, composition)
		\item \textbf{Object Detection:} Leverages existing JSON metadata (group photos $\rightarrow$ Extraversion)
		\item Color profiles via k-means clustering (HSV space)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Text Features:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item LIWC categories extended for Tagalog
		\item Bilingual sentiment analysis (English/Tagalog)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Metadata Features:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Behavioral indicators (\texttt{Following Count}, post frequency)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intermediate Feature Fusion}
\label{subsec:fusion}

Our hybrid fusion approach combines modalities at the feature level:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Modality-Specific Encoding:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Images: VGG-19 embeddings (4,096-D)
		\item Text: TF-IDF weighted LIWC features
		\item Metadata: Min-max scaled
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Concatenation:} Unified feature vector per user
	
	\item \textbf{Dynamic Weighting:} Attention mechanism prioritizes informative modalities:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Higher weight for images in Openness prediction
		\item Text prioritized for Neuroticism
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Training}
\label{subsec:models}
Each model will be trained independently for each feature (single modality) and fused as well (intermediate fusion).

\subsubsection{Support Vector Machines (SVM)}
\label{subsubsec:svm}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Rationale:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Effective with high-dimensional fused features \cite{farnadi2018}
		\item RBF kernel handles non-linear relationships
		\item Robust to overfitting with medium-sized data
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Implementation:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Grid search for optimal \texttt{C} and \texttt{gamma}
		\item Class weights adjusted for trait imbalance
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{XGBoost}
\label{subsubsec:xgboost}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Rationale:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Native handling of heterogeneous features \cite{chen2016}
		\item Built-in feature importance analysis
		\item Efficient with structured data
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Implementation:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Early stopping with \texttt{max\_depth=6}
		\item \texttt{learning\_rate=0.1} with 500 estimators
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Model Analysis}
\label{subsec:analysis}
The metrics below will be used to compare per label the effectiveness of the multimodality approach between the single modality approaches.	 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Evaluation Metrics:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Macro-F1 (addresses class imbalance)
		\item AUC-ROC (trait discrimination capability)
		\item SHAP values for interpretability
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Ablation Studies:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Modality contribution analysis
		\item Single vs. fused feature performance
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
