% Describe the research area
%Research area ...
%This study's main research area is on personality computing. Personality computing is related to artificial intelligence and personality psychology by studying one's personality through a variety of computational techniques from different sources (usually text, multimedia, and social networks). Among the three main problems personality computing addresses; automatic personality recognition, perception, and synthesis \citep[p.~280]{Vinciarelli2014}; this study focuses on automatic personality recognition.

% Describe the domain (where will you apply the topic)

Personality is defined as “patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior” \citep{Vinciarelli2014}. For purposes of personality computing, personality is broken down into various characteristics that can be measured quantitatively \citep{Vinciarelli2014}. The most widely used model in this field is the Big Five Personality Model, which comprises the traits of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. Other well-known models include the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Cattell Sixteen Personality Factor (16PF). Using these models, the traditional method of measuring personality is by using a multiple-choice questionnaire \citep{farnadi2018}, wherein each choice corresponds to a value for each personality characteristic. These values are then aggregated to obtain the final results, which may take the form of numerical scores for each trait or categorical classifications. Understanding personality plays a significant role in fields such as psychology, as this information can be used in studies of mental health and human behavior. It has also garnered increasing interest in the fields of social science, business, education, and healthcare \citep{Miller2014} as it offers valuable insights into individual differences and supports more personalized approaches in these domains.

However, these traditional methods of identifying personality are time-consuming and may be inconvenient for participants \citep{chen2016}, prompting the need for alternative methods to obtain these results. This leads us to the field of Automatic Personality Recognition (APR). APR aims to infer an individual’s personality based on their digital footprint. APR has been traced back to the work of \citet{Pennebaker1999} wherein they asked the question of \textit{can language use reflect personality style?} APR studies typically use inputs such as text, audio, or visual data, along with an individual’s personality trait scores, to train machine learning models. These models aim to analyze patterns and identify correlations in order to form accurate personality predictions, which may be either categorical or continuous (regression-based) in nature.

% Give a synthesis of previous work

% Synthesis of previous studies...
%\citet{Pennebaker1999} and \citet{Mairesse2007} had demonstrated the different ways of detecting personalities and emotions by analyzing the text with various language models. Due to that, social media had became a common place for the research of personality detection. The PagkataoKo dataset has been made with social media activity on Instagram and X (formerly known as Twitter). There were more studies using X's data than Instagram due to X being a more prominent platform with its text-based posts. However, \citet{ferwerda2016}, \cite{Reece2017-qw} and \cite{Harris2019-gq} made studies that showed analyzing photos was possible. Thus, researching on Instagram became more meaningful in this manner.

Early studies in APR predominantly focused on text-based features, and more recent work has expanded to include multimodal data, such as images and videos \citep{Mehta2020}, reflecting the evolving nature of online content. The standard approach involves feature extraction, followed by machine learning techniques to associate extracted features with personality traits. Support vector machines (SVMs) are commonly used in APR studies. However, many have also found success with deep learning approaches \citep{Zhao2022} such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

With the widespread adoption of social networking sites (SNS), personal content such as images, captions, and interactions has become publicly available on a large scale, providing accessible behavioral data for personality analysis and greater opportunity for research. Prior research suggests that user-generated content on these platforms often reflects personal expression in spontaneous and unintended ways \citep{Vinciarelli2014}, making them valuable for computational personality inference. Thus, many studies have taken to conducting personality analysis using data from personal social media profiles. Text was a common modality in their research, though a smaller number of papers have also explored image-based analysis. 

Most existing APR studies have predominantly focused on Western populations, but progress in APR studies of non-Western languages is slowly being made, including Filipino. Filipino APR is a growing subfield that has started to gain increasing interest. This area presents unique challenges, such as frequent code-switching and the presence of diverse regional languages \citep{tighe_acorda_2022}. However, existing studies in this field have primarily focused on either the activity and usage of social media itself or on a text-based linguistic analysis of social media posts made by Filipinos in order to predict personality. There is a heavier focus on textual data as a modality, particularly X (formerly Twitter) data, while image-based and multimodal approaches remain largely underexplored. Platforms like Instagram offer a rich source of multimodal data, specifically images and text, that could notably improve personality analysis \citep{Skowron2016}. Furthermore, numerous studies show improved performance when multiple modalities are analyzed over just a single modality \citep{batrinca_multimodal_2016, lima_sequential_2022}. This presents the opportunity to explore a multimodal approach to Filipino APR using Instagram image data in addition to text data, which has the potential to improve upon existing models and yield more accurate results.

% State the problem and the research question

% Paragraph containing the Problem Statement or the Research Question.

This study seeks to explore multimodal APR methods tailored for Filipino users by leveraging Instagram data, integrating psychological analysis and computational techniques. The study aims to address the question: \textit{How effective is multimodal Instagram data as a source for recognizing manifestations of Filipino personality traits?}

% This section ends with a discussion on the problem/s faced by or that still exist in the specific technology or field (e.g., limitations of existing software or algorithms). It should not contain your research objectives or goal; instead, the problem statement would lead to the research objectives to be stated in 1.2.

% \subsection{Figures}

% Often times, a graph, illustration, screenshot, or any image can help a reader better understand what we say in text. In academic writing, we call them \textbf{figures}. Please add as many figures as necessary to help build your narrative, but do not go overboard. 

% You can add figures in JPG or PNG format as shown in Figure \ref{fig:disneystock}. All figures should also have a descriptive caption. As a general principle, your caption should adequately describe what is shown in the figure, and not just short texts. If we remove all the surrounding text, the reader should still understand what your figure is. 

% All figures should be referred to at least once in the surrounding paragraphs. Make sure that you explain what the figure is all about, and that you refer to your figure. You can also use the surround paragraphs to highlight key insights or parts of your figure. For example, \figref{fig:disneystock} shows a graph of the performance of Disney stock from the 1980s to 2012.

% %--- the following example shows how to include a figure in PNG format
% \begin{figure}[t]                %-- use [t] to place figure at top, [b] to place at the bottom, [h] for here
%    \centering                    %-- use this to center the figure
%    \includegraphics{DisneyChart.png}      %-- include image file named as "disneychart.png" 
%    \caption{Disney's stock price chart from the 1980s up to 2012. The top chart shows the stock price in each month. The bottom chart shows the change in volume of transactions. The bars are colored based on the type of movement that happened in a month.}
%     \label{fig:disneystock}

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Research}
\label{sec:scopelimitations}


	This study aims to develop a multimodal personality recognition framework that predicts Filipino Instagram users' Big Five personality traits using both image and text data. The following outlines and discusses the scope, limitations, and rationale for each specific research objective
	
	\subsection{Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset}
	
	\textbf{Why should this objective be done?} \\
	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is necessary to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and quality. It helps identify patterns, inconsistencies, and potential biases within Instagram images and captions, which will inform and improve subsequent stages of feature extraction and modeling.
	
	\textbf{Scope, limitations, and rationale:} \\
	The EDA is limited to Instagram posts that contain both images and captions, ensuring that the dataset is suitable for the intended multimodal analysis. Posts lacking either modality are excluded, as they do not contribute to the core objective of integrating text and image data. Additionally, social interaction metrics such as likes, comments, or follower counts fall outside the scope, as this study focuses solely on content-based personality cues rather than social engagement behaviors.
	
	\subsection{Structure and extract features from the image and text data present in the finalized subset}
	
	\textbf{Why should this objective be done?} \\
	Raw social media data is inherently unstructured and cannot be directly used for personality trait prediction. Effective preprocessing and feature extraction are required to convert images and captions into structured, machine-readable formats that capture relevant personality-related features.
	
	\textbf{Scope, limitations, and rationale:} \\
	For text processing, only captions written in English or Filipino will be considered, with linguistic and sentiment-based features extracted. Hashtags, emojis, user bios, and other forms of textual metadata are excluded to reduce noise and maintain focus on personality-relevant linguistic signals. For image processing, the study is limited to edge detection techniques, color composition analysis, and basic content features. Advanced image processing methods, such as deep semantic segmentation or complex object detection, are excluded to ensure methodological clarity and computational efficiency.
	
	\subsection{Train machine learning models for predicting users' Big Five personality traits}
	
	\textbf{Why should this objective be done?} \\
	Training machine learning models is essential to operationalize the proposed multimodal framework and empirically evaluate its ability to predict personality traits based on the extracted image and text features.
	
	\textbf{Scope, limitations, and rationale:} \\
	The modeling process is confined to classification-based approaches, as the goal is to assign users to discrete personality trait categories rather than predict continuous scores. Only Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost are considered, given their proven performance and compatibility with moderately sized datasets. Deep learning models, while potentially powerful, are excluded to prioritize interpretability and avoid overfitting, considering the dataset's size constraints.
	
	\subsection{Evaluate the predictive performance of the proposed multimodal framework}
	
	\textbf{Why should this objective be done?} \\
	Evaluating the framework is critical to determining whether the integration of image and text data results in improved personality prediction performance compared to unimodal models.
	
	\textbf{Scope, limitations, and rationale:} \\
	The evaluation is limited to within-dataset testing, using standard metrics such as Macro-F1 score and AUC-ROC to assess classification performance. The framework is designed specifically for Filipino Instagram users, limiting the generalizability of results to other populations, cultures, or social media platforms.

\section{Significance of the Study}
\label{sec: Significance}

This study aims to address the current research gap in Philippine Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) by exploring how multimodal data specifically, image and text content from Instagram can be used to infer personality traits among Filipino users. While most existing APR studies for Filipinos rely heavily on text-based data from platforms such as Twitter, this research expands the scope by incorporating visual analysis, introducing an image-based component into the local APR landscape.

By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), this study contributes to understanding the structural and demographic characteristics of Filipino Instagram data that are relevant for personality recognition. This helps establish a foundation for the appropriate development of computational models in this domain.

The study also demonstrates the practical application of feature extraction and fusion techniques for processing multimodal Instagram data in the Philippine context. Through the development and evaluation of machine learning models using combined image and text features, this research provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness of multimodal approaches compared to traditional unimodal methods.

While the primary contribution is academic, the study's findings offer broader implications for future work in culturally sensitive APR systems and personality computing. Moreover, this research provides a foundation for building more inclusive, localized models that account for the unique linguistic, cultural, and behavioral patterns of Filipino social media users.
