%%This section gives the reader an overview of the specific technology or field in the international or local setting. The information regarding the technology or field should be contemporary and not

%%Follow the inverted pyramid to describe each of the following. Allocate one (1) paragraph per level in the pyramid. 

% Describe the research area
Personality is defined as “patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior” \citep{Vinciarelli2014}. In a society, people develop opinions and treat each other differently based on their perception of the person’s personality. Understanding personality plays a significant role in fields such as psychology as this information can be used in studies of mental health and human behavior. 
%Research area ...
%This study's main research area is on personality computing. Personality computing is related to artificial intelligence and personality psychology by studying one's personality through a variety of computational techniques from different sources (usually text, multimedia, and social networks). Among the three main problems personality computing addresses; automatic personality recognition, perception, and synthesis \citep[p.~280]{Vinciarelli2014}; this study focuses on automatic personality recognition.
With the widespread adoption of social networking sites (SNS), personal content such as images, captions, and interactions has become publicly accessible on a large scale. This development has opened new avenues for research on personality inference using digital footprints. One such approach is Automatic Personality Recognition (APR), which involves inferring a person’s personality traits from their online activity.

% Describe the domain (where will you apply the topic)
Automatic personality recognition (APR) aims to infer the personality of an individual based on their digital footprint. APR has been traced back to the work of \citet{Pennebaker1999} wherein they asked the question of \textit{can language use reflect personality style?}

APR typically uses the Big Five Personality Model, which includes the traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. Researchers have explored various machine learning techniques—particularly deep learning models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs)—to link digital content to these personality traits. While early studies predominantly analyzed text-based features, more recent work has expanded to include multimodal data, such as images and videos, reflecting the evolving nature of online content.

Social media platforms like Instagram, which emphasize visual content, offer unique opportunities for personality analysis. Prior research suggests that user-generated content on these platforms often reflects personal expression in spontaneous and unintended ways, making them valuable for computational personality inference.
% Give a synthesis of previous work

% Synthesis of previous studies...
%\citet{Pennebaker1999} and \citet{Mairesse2007} had demonstrated the different ways of detecting personalities and emotions by analyzing the text with various language models. Due to that, social media had became a common place for the research of personality detection. The PagkataoKo dataset has been made with social media activity on Instagram and X (formerly known as Twitter). There were more studies using X's data than Instagram due to X being a more prominent platform with its text-based posts. However, \citet{ferwerda2016}, \cite{Reece2017-qw} and \cite{Harris2019-gq} made studies that showed analyzing photos was possible. Thus, researching on Instagram became more meaningful in this manner.
Previous studies have found success in the implementation of deep learning and deep neural networks in the field of APR \citep{Zhao2022}. The standard approach involves feature extraction, followed by machine learning techniques to associate extracted features with personality traits. Common models include deep neural networks (DNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). 

The widespread adoption of social media has further propelled APR research, providing large-scale, real-time behavioral data for personality inference. Studies suggest that social media interactions exhibit behavior that is “spontaneous and self-disclosing beyond intention” \citep{Vinciarelli2014}, making them valuable for personality analysis. Thus, many studies have taken to conducting personality analysis using data from personal social media profiles. Text was a common modality in their research, though a smaller number of papers have also explored image-based analysis. 

Despite growing research in APR, most studies have primarily focused on Western populations. Limited research has explored personality inference methods within Filipino contexts, particularly in using image-based data.

There are a number of studies that show improved performance of models when using multimodal approaches rather than unimodal, yet this approach remains largely underexplored in the context of Filipino automatic personality recognition (APR). Most existing studies focus solely on single-modal data, particularly text data. However, platforms like Instagram offer a rich source of multimodal data, specifically images and text, that could notably improve personality analysis. Exploring this untapped resource appears promising, especially considering the previous success of multimodal approaches in non-Filipino contexts.

% State the problem and the research question

% Paragraph containing the Problem Statement or the Research Question.

This study seeks to explore image-based APR methods tailored for Filipino users by leveraging Instagram data, integrating psychological analysis and computational techniques. The study aims to address the question: \textit{How can Instagram content, including images and captions, be used to infer a Filipino’s personality traits based on psychological and computational analysis?}

% This section ends with a discussion on the problem/s faced by or that still exist in the specific technology or field (e.g., limitations of existing software or algorithms). It should not contain your research objectives or goal; instead, the problem statement would lead to the research objectives to be stated in 1.2.

% \subsection{Figures}

% Often times, a graph, illustration, screenshot, or any image can help a reader better understand what we say in text. In academic writing, we call them \textbf{figures}. Please add as many figures as necessary to help build your narrative, but do not go overboard. 

% You can add figures in JPG or PNG format as shown in Figure \ref{fig:disneystock}. All figures should also have a descriptive caption. As a general principle, your caption should adequately describe what is shown in the figure, and not just short texts. If we remove all the surrounding text, the reader should still understand what your figure is. 

% All figures should be referred to at least once in the surrounding paragraphs. Make sure that you explain what the figure is all about, and that you refer to your figure. You can also use the surround paragraphs to highlight key insights or parts of your figure. For example, \figref{fig:disneystock} shows a graph of the performance of Disney stock from the 1980s to 2012.

% %--- the following example shows how to include a figure in PNG format
% \begin{figure}[t]                %-- use [t] to place figure at top, [b] to place at the bottom, [h] for here
%    \centering                    %-- use this to center the figure
%    \includegraphics{DisneyChart.png}      %-- include image file named as "disneychart.png" 
%    \caption{Disney's stock price chart from the 1980s up to 2012. The top chart shows the stock price in each month. The bottom chart shows the change in volume of transactions. The bars are colored based on the type of movement that happened in a month.}

\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec: objectives}
The integration of visual and textual data from social media platforms has emerged as a promising approach for inferring individual personality traits. Building upon this foundation, the primary aim of this study is to develop a multimodal framework for the automatic recognition of personality traits among Filipino Instagram users, utilizing both image and caption data. This research seeks to contribute to the field of personality computing by demonstrating how multimodal social media content can be harnessed for psychological assessment, with a specific focus on the Filipino demographic.

To achieve this aim, the study will pursue the following specific objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):} \\
	Perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset to examine the distribution, structure, and characteristics of the collected Instagram images and captions. This step is essential to identify relevant patterns, assess data quality, and inform subsequent stages of feature extraction and modeling.
	
	\item \textbf{Extract and Fuse Multimodal Features from Images and Captions:} \\
	Apply computer vision techniques to extract visual features from Instagram images—such as color schemes, composition, and depicted content—and natural language processing techniques to derive textual features from user captions—such as lexical diversity, sentiment, and linguistic style. These features will be fused to form a comprehensive representation of each user's social media activity.
	
	\item \textbf{Train Machine Learning Models for Personality Trait Prediction:} \\
	Develop machine learning models that utilize the combined multimodal feature sets to predict users’ personality traits. The study will investigate the effectiveness of various learning algorithms and evaluate the benefits of integrating visual and textual data in improving predictive performance.
	
	\item \textbf{Evaluate the Predictive Performance of the Framework:} \\
	Assess the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal personality recognition framework by comparing its performance to unimodal approaches that rely solely on either images or text. Evaluation will be based on appropriate metrics to determine predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.
\end{enumerate}

By achieving these objectives, this research aims to contribute to the field of personality computing by offering a comprehensive understanding of how Instagram content can be utilized for personality assessment, with a particular focus on the Filipino demographic.

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Research}
\label{sec:scopelimitations}


	This study aims to develop a multimodal personality recognition framework that predicts Filipino Instagram users’ Big Five personality traits using both image and text data. The following outlines the scope, limitations, and rationale for each research objective.
	\subsection{Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset}
	
	EDA is essential to understand the dataset’s structure, distribution, and quality. It helps uncover patterns, inconsistencies, and potential biases within Instagram images and captions, informing subsequent feature extraction and modeling processes.
	
	The study focuses exclusively on Instagram posts that contain both images and captions to ensure suitability for multimodal analysis. Posts lacking either modality are excluded. Social interaction metrics such as likes, comments, and follower counts are beyond the scope, as the study emphasizes content-based personality signals, not engagement behaviors.
	
	\subsection{Structure and extract features from the image and text data}
	Social media data is inherently unstructured and cannot be directly used for personality trait prediction. Preprocessing and feature extraction are required to convert images and captions into structured, machine-readable formats that capture relevant personality-related cues.
	
	The study will process captions in any language, including English, Filipino, regional dialects, or other languages that may be present in the dataset. The presence of multiple languages is acknowledged as a natural characteristic of Filipino Instagram use, particularly given code-switching tendencies and the multicultural linguistic environment. However, the primary analytical focus remains on English and Filipino captions, as these are the most prevalent based on prior research and the PagkataoKo dataset. Emojis, hashtags, and links will be minimally cleaned but retained as meaningful tokens (e.g., links will be tokenized as “[LINK]”), recognizing their relevance in expressing personality and emotion.
	
	The study recognizes that Instagram is a highly visual platform, and the images shared by users offer rich, often spontaneous cues that can be indicative of personality traits. To effectively extract relevant information, this research employs a two-pronged image processing approach:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Photo Characteristics Analysis} \\
		This aspect focuses on the low-level visual properties of the images, which previous studies have shown to correlate with personality traits. Specifically, the following features will be extracted:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Color Composition}: Using color space transformations (e.g., HSV color space) and clustering techniques (e.g., k-means clustering), dominant colors will be identified. Research has indicated that certain colors, such as warmer hues (e.g., red, orange) are associated with Openness, while cooler tones (e.g., blue) may relate to Conscientiousness.
			\item \textbf{Brightness and Saturation}: Global image brightness and saturation levels will be computed, as these have been linked to personality traits such as Extraversion (associated with brighter, more saturated images) and Neuroticism (darker, muted images).
			\item \textbf{Image Size and Resolution}: Image dimensions and resolution will be recorded to account for possible differences in image quality or user posting behavior that may relate to personality traits.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Image Content Analysis} \\
		Beyond visual aesthetics, the semantic content of images provides higher-level cues relevant to personality. The following techniques will be employed to extract content-based features:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Object and Scene Detection}: Pre-trained deep learning models, such as the Google Vision API or similar object recognition frameworks, will be used to identify objects, people, and common scenes present in the images. For example, frequent posting of selfies or group photos may indicate higher levels of Extraversion, while nature scenes or artistic compositions may signal Openness.
			\item \textbf{Face Detection and Count}: Using algorithms such as OpenCV's Haar cascades, the presence and quantity of faces in an image will be detected. This serves as a proxy for social engagement tendencies, as prior research has linked higher face presence with Extraversion.
			\item \textbf{Contextual Features}: Where possible, image metadata or contextual tags (e.g., inferred location such as beaches, cafes, or landmarks) will be utilized to enrich content understanding.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	All image features, both low-level and high-level, will be converted into structured, machine-readable formats to be integrated with textual features in the multimodal personality recognition framework.
	
	\subsection{Train Machine Learning Models for Personality Trait Prediction
	}
	
	Model training operationalizes the proposed multimodal framework and enables empirical evaluation of its ability to predict personality traits based on extracted features.

	The models are limited to classification based approaches to assign users to discrete personality categories. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost will be utilized due to their strong performance and suitability for medium-scale datasets. Deep learning models, though powerful, are excluded to ensure interpretability and mitigate overfitting risks, considering dataset size.
	
	\subsection{Evaluate the predictive performance of the proposed multimodal framework}
	
	Evaluation determines whether integrating image and text data improves personality prediction compared to unimodal models.
	
	Evaluation is confined to within dataset testing using metrics such as Macro-F1 score and AUC-ROC. The study specifically targets Filipino Instagram users, limiting the generalizability of results to other populations, cultures, or platforms.
	

% This section discusses the boundaries, with respect to the objectives, of the research and the constraints within which the research will be developed. Describe what is and is not included in the scope of your research, supported by your main research question and findings of previous studies. Do not use weak excuses such as the lack of time and/or knowledge to perform the research.

% A good rule of thumb is to allocate one paragraph for each of your specific objectives that (1) contains a brief overview of the concept/theory and the purpose of doing the associated objective; and (2) includes a description of the scope/limitation of your study, and followed by brief purpose, rationale and/or justification for your decisions.

\section{Significance of the Study}
\label{sec: Significance}

The field of Filipino Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) is still emerging, presenting unique challenges due to the country's linguistic diversity and rich cultural context. While progress has been made, existing research remains largely limited to text-based analysis, particularly from platforms such as Twitter. This study seeks to expand Filipino APR by exploring the use of multimodal data — specifically, integrating both image and text content from Instagram.

The expansion of Filipino APR towards multimodal analysis is especially important given that Instagram users express themselves through both language and visual content. Although global research suggests that multimodal approaches can enhance personality prediction, such methods have not been sufficiently explored in the Filipino context. This study aims to investigate this gap rather than assume its success, with the goal of evaluating whether visual text integration can enrich personality inference for Filipino Instagram users.

In line with this, the study offers the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It explores the use of multimodal data (image and text) for Filipino APR, addressing the current research gap and assessing whether this approach can meaningfully improve personality prediction.
	
	\item It acknowledges and addresses the complexities of Filipino linguistic expression, including:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Code switching between English, Filipino, and regional dialects;
		\item The frequent use of emojis, hashtags, and links;
		\item Multimodal communication patterns prevalent on Instagram.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item It conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Filipino Instagram data to establish an empirical foundation for understanding content patterns relevant to personality traits.
	
	\item The research demonstrates practical methods for multimodal feature extraction and fusion, tailored to the Philippine social media landscape. This ensures that the methodologies account for both cultural and technological realities of how Filipinos express themselves online.
\end{itemize}
Beyond academic contributions, this study informs the development of culturally sensitive personality computing systems. By highlighting the importance of multimodal, localized approaches, it lays the groundwork for future research and applications that better reflect the linguistic, cultural, and behavioral patterns of Filipino social media users.
